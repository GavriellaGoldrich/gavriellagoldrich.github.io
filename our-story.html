                <p>When it comes to restaurants, there really are few places (kosher or not) that make everything from scratch.</p>
                <p>Literally, just about everything from french fries to our pizza, soups to hero bread, mozzarella sticks to sauces and dressings, as well as our herring, hummus, dips and more are made fresh right here in our restaurant.</p>        
                <p>Back in May of 2014, Gideon Fentin started Giddy's Pizzeria after making pizzas at a cafe and interning in a restaurant in Teaneck. Gideon wanted to open a restaurant where people would be able to come and enjoy fresh homemade food. After speaking with many people, he felt that East Brunswick would be a great location, and he decided to open East Brunswick's first kosher restaurant.</p>
                <p>In the early part of 2015, Lawrence Margolin, became partners with Gideon, bringing close to 20 years of experience as a chef, caterer and restaurant and food service manager. Lawrence brings his recipes for soups, sauces, dressings, herring (in various sauces), hummus and dips, as well as many other new menu items.</p> 
                <p>Whether you want to come and dine in, take out or have your food delivered, we would like to be a part of your dining experience. We cater for any and all occasions. From bris to kiddush, bar/bat Mitzvah to home or office party, no party is too small for us to cater. We can do both, drop off jobs and full service catering.</p>
                <p>Together, Gideon and Lawrence are bringing new, gourmet flavors to East Brunswick and central New Jersey.</p>
